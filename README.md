TES3MP is a project adding multiplayer functionality to [OpenMW](https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw), an open-source game engine that supports playing "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" by Bethesda Softworks.

[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)

As of version 0.8.0, TES3MP is fully playable, providing very extensive player, NPC, world and quest synchronization, as well as state saving and loading, all of which are highly customizable via [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts).

Remaining gameplay problems mostly relate to AI and the fact that clientside script variables need to be placed on a synchronization whitelist to avoid packet spam.

Donations
---------------

You can benefit the project by donating on Patreon to our two developers, [David Cernat](https://www.patreon.com/davidcernat) and [Koncord](https://www.patreon.com/Koncord), as well as by supporting [OpenMW](https://openmw.org).

Contributing
---------------

Helping us with documentation, bug hunting and video showcases is always greatly appreciated.

For code contributions, it's best to start out with modestly sized fixes and features and work your way up. There are so many different possible implementations of more major features – many of which would cause undesirable code or vision conflicts with OpenMW – that those should be talked over in advance with the existing developers before effort is spent on them.

Feel free to contact the [team members](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/blob/master/tes3mp-credits.md) for any questions you might have.

OpenMW is an open-source game engine that supports playing Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own the game for OpenMW to play Morrowind.

OpenMW also comes with OpenMW-CS, a replacement for Bethesda's Construction Set.

Current Status
--------------

The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/issues?label_name%5B%5D=1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/wikis/features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

Pre-existing modifications created for the original Morrowind engine can be hit-and-miss. The OpenMW script compiler performs more thorough error-checking than Morrowind does, meaning that a mod created for Morrowind may not necessarily run in OpenMW. Some mods also rely on quirky behaviour or engine bugs in order to work. We are considering such compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis - in some cases adding a workaround to OpenMW may be feasible, in other cases fixing the mod will be the only option. If you know of any mods that work or don't work, feel free to add them to the [Mod status](https://old-wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Mod_status) wiki page.

The data path
-------------

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. If you run the launcher, OpenMW should be able to pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly (installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).
